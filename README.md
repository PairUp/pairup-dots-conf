rkingy-dots
===========

The first example of using the [...](http://github.com/ingydotnet/....git)
system as a social config.

Useful for:

- Setting up pair-programming environments
- Trying out other peoples' configs
- Finding the "just right" place for a script or config snippet (that is,
  having a good place to upstream/downstream pieces)

To Use
------

git clone git@github.com:ingydotnet/rkingy-dots.git &&
    cd rkingy-dots &&
    ./install &&
    exec bash

After that sequence, all the scripts and configs should be linked into place.

To Set Up Your Own
